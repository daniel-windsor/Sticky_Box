# Sticky Box

A Phaser.JS Challenge

Line drag based on this example: https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/paths/curves/drag-line-curve

- The two circles and the box can be dragged around the screen.
- When a circle collides with the box they will stick together.  Dragging the box will drag the cirle with it.
- Sticking a circle to a box activates an event listener.  Click anywhere to change the background colour.
- Seperate the box and circle to deactivate the listener.
