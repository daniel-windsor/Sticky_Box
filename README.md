# Sticky Box

A Phaser.JS Challenge

Line drag based on this example: https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/paths/curves/drag-line-curve

- The circles and boxes can be dragged around the screen.
- When a circle collides with the box they will stick together.  Dragging the box will drag the circle with it.
- Sticking any circle to a box activates an event listener.  Click anywhere to change the background colour.
- Separate all boxes and circles to deactivate the listener.
